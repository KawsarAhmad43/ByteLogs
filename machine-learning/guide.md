###### OpenCV:
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is an open-source library of computer vision and image processing functions. 
1. Image processing and manipulation.
2. Object detection and tracking in images or videos.
3. Facial recognition and analysis.
4. Feature detection and description.
5. Image segmentation.
6. Camera calibration for accurate measurements and distortion correction.
7. Augmented reality applications.
8. Gesture recognition.
9. Optical character recognition (OCR).
10. Integration with machine learning frameworks for computer vision tasks.
