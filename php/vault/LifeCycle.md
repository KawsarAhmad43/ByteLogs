# Life Cycle

```PHP```
- Client Request: The life cycle begins when a client sends a request to the PHP application, typically through a web server. The request contains information such as the requested URL, HTTP method, and any data sent with the request.

- Web Server Handling: The web server, such as Apache or Nginx, receives the client request and forwards it to the appropriate PHP handler, usually in the form of a PHP FastCGI Process Manager (PHP-FPM)
