**Supervised Learning - Linear Regression Example**

In this example, we will use supervised learning with linear regression to predict the output based on the input data.

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample data
X = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
y = np.array([2, 4, 5, 4, 5])

# Your linear regression model implementation here...

# Predict the output for a new input
new_input = 6
predicted_output = your_model.predict(new_input)
```

### Unsupervised Learning - K-Means Clustering Example

**Unsupervised Learning - K-Means Clustering Example**

In this example, we will use unsupervised learning with K-Means clustering to group data points based on their similarities.

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import numpy as np

# Sample data points
X = np.array([[1, 2], [1.5, 1.8], [5, 8], [8, 8], [1, 0.6], [9, 11]])

# Your K-Means clustering implementation here...

# Plot the data points and cluster centers
your_plotting_function(X, centers)
```

### Reinforcement Learning - Q-Learning Example (FrozenLake)

**Reinforcement Learning - Q-Learning Example (FrozenLake)**

In this example, we will use reinforcement learning with Q-Learning to make an agent learn how to navigate the FrozenLake environment.

```python
import gym

# Create the FrozenLake environment
env = gym.make('FrozenLake-v1')

# Your Q-Learning algorithm implementation here...

# Play the game using the learned Q-values
your_play_game_function(env, Q)
