# When to Use Each:
* Use Logistic Regression: 
When interpretability of the model is essential, and you need probability estimates as output.
It is suitable for cases with linearly separable data or when the relationship between features and target is expected to be linear.

* Use Support Vector Machines (SVM):
When you have a small or medium-sized dataset and need a robust model with good generalization. 
SVM is effective when the data is not linearly separable or when you want to leverage the kernel trick for non-linear decision boundaries.
